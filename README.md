# HTML-CSS-Selectors

Navigate to https://go.okstate.edu/. Scroll down toward the bottom of the webpage where you will see news snippets. These are updated fairly often.

Notice the title of each article is an anchor tag <a></a> which contains a url to open a new webpage for the articles. For this part of the assignment, you will need to complete the following tasks:

Create a CSS selector for the anchor tags using only the anchor tag and ignoring container tags (i.e. <div>).
Create a CSS selector for the anchor tags starting with a <div> tag that contains the anchor tag. 

Generate a CSS selector for only the first news article using the pseudo-class selector nth-child(). 

Now perform the same task using a different pseudo-class syntax 

Generate a CSS selector for only the second news article using nth-child().

Perform this task using a different pseudo-class 

Wikipedia 

Pulling data from tables in Wikipedia can be very beneficial. Wikipedia contains a lot of tabular data which is freely available. One important note here: If you do plan on using data from Wikipedia, check the sources of the data first to ensure their integrity. Like many other things on Wikipedia, the content may not be completely accurate despite the best intentions of the authors.

I will use the following webpage: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate. This provides details on crude brith rate. This webpage contains a small table that on "World Historical and Projected Crude Birth Rates (1950-2050)" 


Using this table, we will generate the CSS selectors for the following:

The first column Years 
The second column CBR 
The third column Years 
The fourth column CBR 

The table's title contains a link referencing a source at the end of the page, this is [8] which is Note 8.

Create a CSS selector for this anchor tag
